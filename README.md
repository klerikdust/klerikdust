# It's me, Nabil. ðŸ˜º
A keen full stack developer and UI/UX enthusiast based in Indonesia. I've been working on a couple of software-related projects both for individuals and companies since past years. My current fave stack is revolving around node.js, SQL, Vue3, and other web frameworks with over 3 years of experience. I'm eager to expand my skillset whenever I have the opportunity to do it. :)
